# Iris Dataset Exploration

## Task Objective
Explore the Iris dataset to understand its structure, feature distributions, relationships between variables, and detect potential outliers using visualization and statistical analysis.

## Dataset Used
- **Iris dataset** (available via seaborn or CSV)
- 150 samples, 4 numeric features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
- 1 categorical target variable (species)

## Models Applied
- No predictive model applied; task focused on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**

## Key Results and Findings
- Petal length and petal width are highly discriminative for separating species.
- Sepal features are less informative.
- Dataset is clean, well-structured, and suitable for classification.
- Scatter plots, histograms, and box plots revealed feature relationships and minor outliers.
